        description: "Knee pain can be due to an injury, a mechanical problem, or even types of arthritis which affects people of all ages. Since knee is a weight-bearing joint, any of the mentioned conditions can affect biomechanics of the lower back, hip, leg and ankle. Manual Osteopathy practitioners assist the joint and muscle imbalances of the knee which results in decreased pain and increase in function. The practitioner looks at how the knee is being influenced from ankle, foot, hip and the lower back and use Mobilization or Muscle Energy Technique to stretch muscles, improve joint movement, reduce inflammation, and promote healing."
